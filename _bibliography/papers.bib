  title="COLLATOR: Consistent Spatial-Temporal Longitudinal Atlas Construction via Implicit Neural Representation.",

  year="2023",
  abstract="Longitudinal brain atlases are essential tools for studying brain development. However, existing atlases often suffer from temporal inconsistency, due to the typical atlas construction method that averages brain images on discrete time points independently. Additionally, the differences in onto-genetic trends among samples at different time points further compound this issue. These inconsistencies may significantly impact the accuracy of brain developmental characteristic analysis. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage deep-learning framework to address this issue by treating it as a 4D image denoising task, where the 4D data consists of 3D brain volumes and 1D age. Our framework employs implicit neural representation to construct a continuous and noise-free longitudinal brain atlas as a function of the 4D spatial-temporal coordinate. We evaluate our approach on two modalities of brain atlases (QSM and fetus atlases) and show that our method significantly improves temporal consistency while maintaining accurate representation of brain structures. Furthermore, the continuous functions generated by our method can be used to generate 4D atlases with higher spatial and temporal resolution.",
