I am Qing Wu (吴晴 in Chinese), a 4th year Ph.D. student in [SMILE:smile: LAB](https://smilelab.com.cn/) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), advised by Prof. [Yuyao Zhang](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/2020/0814/c7582a54827/page.htm). Before that, I received my B.E. degree at [China University of Geosciences, Wuhan](https://en.cug.edu.cn/) in 2020.

I am interested in a variety of topics related to <strong>inverse problems</strong>. Currently, my research is focused on: 
* Spectral CT Imging
* Neural Representation<br>
* CT Material Decomposition<br>
* Undersampling CT Reconstruction<br>
